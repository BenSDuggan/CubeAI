# Changes

## 1.0.1a

CubeAI is finally going to be updated from the version made at the end of 2018. The goal of this version is to update the project structure and get an early version on PyPI.  The next goal will be to reorganize the modules so they are easier to understand.

### cubeguy

The [cubeguy](/cubeguy) directory will hold the main Python code and will be uploaded to PyPI.
